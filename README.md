# Tour Lead CRUD Test

## Overview

This test is for a simple Django CRUD views to add, edit and display tour leaders.

UI mockup is in [crud-test.html](crud-test.html).

Just implement as much functionality as you can in a time-box of 2 hours focusing fist on quality rather than quantity.

There're a lot of requirements so you're not expected to complete all of them, implement what you can and do it well,
And don't leave half implemented code and functionality, remove anything that's not completely finished in the final result.

## Functionality to implement (in order of priority)

### 1. Add Tour Lead view

Ideally with languages as inline formset where languages can be added/removed in the list.
